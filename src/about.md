## about domino
domino is a tool for collaging fragmented thoughts into a larger idea. 
it's essentially a tool for making a particular kind of mindmap and sharing it
as a page on your website or itch.io.

you can find out more about domino on [the release page][domino]. the source
code for original releases can be found [on github][source].

i'm [mark wonnacott a.k.a candle][me] and i created domino as a 
[response to my frustration][0] trying to express myself in Emilie Reed's
writing jams.

## thanks
**Em Reed** for her writing jams--especially [Speculation Jam][1],
[List Jam][2], [Alternative Ecologies Jam][3] which have deeply inspired me and
also motivated the creation of this tool.

**Max**, **Jazz**, **Ludonaut** for early testing and bug reports.
